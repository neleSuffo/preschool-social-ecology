def load_thresholds(run_dir, mlb_classes):
    """
    Load class-specific optimized thresholds from training run output.
    
    During training, the ThresholdOptimizer callback searches for optimal 
    decision thresholds per class to maximize macro F1-score. These thresholds
    are typically different from the default 0.5 due to class imbalance and
    varying prediction confidence distributions.
    
    Threshold Optimization Process:
    1. During training, validation set predictions are analyzed
    2. For each class, thresholds from 0.1 to 0.9 are tested
    3. The threshold maximizing F1-score per class is selected
    4. Results are saved to thresholds.json in the training run directory
    
    Fallback Strategy:
    If optimized thresholds are not available (e.g., interrupted training),
    the function defaults to 0.5 for all classes with appropriate warnings.
    
    Parameters:
    ----------
    run_dir (str or Path): 
        Training run directory containing threshold optimization results
    mlb_classes (list): 
        List of class names in the same order as model outputs
